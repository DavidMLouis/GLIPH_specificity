# GLIPH_specificity
A pipeline of analysis programs to analyze the difference between two datasets based on the GLIPH algorithm

Using the GLIPH algorithm, GLIPH specificity will run a pipeline taking in the output file, cleaning up the data, splitting the data into separate two separate datasets based on pre-identified markers at the end of the sample (*_data1, *_data2), determine the specificity for each cluster in determining which dataset the motif is leaning towards, running a permutation analysis in order to determine if the clustering is by chance or not, and generating figures for a visualization of the process.



Required packages:
ggplot2
plyr
